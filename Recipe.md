Now we have all the ingredients and now we will start :-

Cake Frosting Cream-
To make the frosting cream, take another bowl, put 2 tablespoon dark chocolate, add sugar powder to taste, 1/2 cup milk and mix it with a whisk or a spoon to a creamy texture. Put this cream aside.

Cake Batter-
To make the cake batter, put 1/2 cup refined oil and 1 cup powdered sugar into a bowl, add 1 teaspoon vanilla essence to it and mix 
Now add 1 cup flour, 2 tablespoon cocoa powder, 1 teaspoon baking soda, 1/2 teaspoon baking powder, 1/2 cup milk and mix

Baking-
Now grease an aluminium tin container with oil, put a butterpaper in it and put the cake batter inside it. Pre-heat the microwave at 180Â° for 10 minutes and leave it. After the pre-heat is over, put the tin container in it for 35-40 minutes.
